# 2cars_game
<b> 2cars_game </b> is a desktop game inspired by <i>Android 2 Cars (by Ketchapp)</i> created using SDL. <br><br>
I write this game as my mini project of Computer Fundamentals and Programming course in Shahid Behesti University (<b>SBU</b>) with c++ programming language and SDL.<br><br>
